Design each log message so that if something fails, you can find the source and root cause without guessing or needing to reproduce the problem.

When designing log messages, always ask:

What information will I need to precisely pinpoint where the error is occurring?
What context will I need in the logs to understand why it happened?
Your log entries should always include:

The exact location (class, method/function, line if possible)
Key input parameters or identifiers relevant to the operation
The specific operation or action being attempted
The error or unexpected condition encountered
Relevant context or state (e.g., user ID, transaction ID, environment)
(Optional) Next steps or hints if possible on how to investigate further
