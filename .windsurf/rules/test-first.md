When designing the code to implement a feature/enhancement/perform change user requested - first create the skeleton and document it including all :param: and :returns: and :raises:
For all params and returns provide examples, like :param: matching id as list - example: [ "1", "6", "7"] 
Then create tests for success (return) and failure (raises).
Then implement methods and run tests.
