# Rule: Write Concise Methods

When designing new methods:
- Ensure the top-level (public) method is concise—ideally 20–30 lines maximum.
- Move all supporting logic and details into well-named private (or inner/helper) methods.
- The top-level method should clearly express the main workflow, delegating specifics to lower-level helpers.

Example:
```python
class SomeObject:
    def main_method(self, id):
        # Inner/helper method for a single, focused operation
        def _short_method(arg): 
            return op(arg)

        target = self._get_target(_short_method(id))
        result = self._do_magic_on(target)
        return result

    def _get_target(self, id):
        # Implementation here
        pass

    def _do_magic_on(self, target):
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

Guidelines:
- Keep the top-level method readable and high-level—think of it as a summary of the operation.
- Each helper/private method should do one thing and have a clear, descriptive name.
- Avoid cramming complex logic into the top-level method; instead, encapsulate details in private helpers.
