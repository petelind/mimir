  # CREATE ACTIVITY (IN DRAFT PLAYBOOK)
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: MCP-ACT-01 Create activity increments grandparent playbook version
    Given draft playbook (id=1, version=0.2) has workflow (id=1)
    When Cascade calls MCP tool "create_activity" with:
      | workflow_id |                                       1 |
      | name        | Define Props Interface                  |
      | guidance    | Document component props and prop types |
      | phase       | Planning                                |
    Then MCP returns success with activity:
      | id          |                      1 |
      | name        | Define Props Interface |
      | order       |                      1 |
      | workflow_id |                      1 |
    And grandparent playbook version is incremented from "0.2" to "0.3"
    And activity is assigned auto-incremented order number

  Scenario: MCP-ACT-02 Create activity with predecessor
    Given workflow (id=1) has activity "Define Props" (id=1)
    And grandparent playbook version is "0.3"
    When Cascade calls "create_activity" with:
      | workflow_id    |              1 |
      | name           | Create Mockup  |
      | guidance       | Design visuals |
      | predecessor_id |              1 |
    Then activity is created with predecessor linked to activity id=1
    And grandparent playbook version increments to "0.4"

  Scenario: MCP-ACT-03 Create activity in released playbook raises permission error
    Given released playbook (id=1, status=released) has workflow (id=1)

      | name        | New Activity |
      | guidance    | Test         |
    Then MCP returns error "PermissionError: Cannot modify released playbook \"[name]\". Use create_pip instead."
    And no activity is created

  Scenario: MCP-ACT-04 Create activity with predecessor in different workflow raises error
    Given workflow (id=1) has activity (id=1)
    And workflow (id=2) exists in same playbook
    When Cascade calls "create_activity" with:
      | workflow_id    |    2 |
      | name           | Test |
      | guidance       | Test |
      | predecessor_id |    1 |
    Then MCP returns error "ValueError: Predecessor activity 1 not found in workflow"

  Scenario: MCP-ACT-05 Create activity with duplicate name raises error
    Given workflow (id=1) has activity "Define Props"
    When Cascade calls "create_activity" with:
      | workflow_id |            1 |
      | name        | Define Props |
      | guidance    | Duplicate    |
    Then MCP returns error "ValidationError: Activity with name 'Define Props' already exists in this workflow"
  # ============================================================================
  # LIST ACTIVITIES
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: MCP-ACT-06 List activities for workflow returns ordered list with dependencies
    Given workflow (id=1) has 3 activities:
      | name            | order | predecessor_id | successor_id |

      | Write Component |     3 |              2 | null         |
    When Cascade calls "list_activities" with:
      | workflow_id | 1 |
    Then MCP returns list of 3 activities ordered by order number
    And each activity includes: id, name, guidance, phase, order, workflow_id, predecessor_id, successor_id

  Scenario: MCP-ACT-07 List activities for non-existent workflow raises error
    When Cascade calls "list_activities" with:

  # ============================================================================
  # END-TO-END WORKFLOW
  # ============================================================================

  Scenario: MCP-ACT-22 Build complete methodology with dependencies via MCP
    Given user requests "Create React methodology with component workflow"
    When Cascade creates playbook (version=0.1)
    And Cascade creates workflow "Component Development" (version=0.2)
    And Cascade creates activity "Define Props" (version=0.3)
    And Cascade creates activity "Create Mockup" (version=0.4)
    And Cascade creates activity "Write Component" (version=0.5)
    And Cascade creates activity "Write Tests" (version=0.6)
    And Cascade sets "Create Mockup" predecessor to "Define Props" (version=0.7)
    And Cascade sets "Write Component" predecessor to "Create Mockup" (version=0.8)
    And Cascade sets "Write Tests" predecessor to "Write Component" (version=0.9)
    Then playbook has dependency chain: Define Props → Create Mockup → Write Component → Write Tests
    And final playbook version is "0.9"
    And dependency graph has no circular dependencies

  Scenario: MCP-ACT-23 AI refines activity guidance iteratively
    Given draft playbook has workflow with activity "Define Props" (version=0.3)
    When user says "Add more detail about TypeScript types"
    And Cascade updates activity guidance with TypeScript examples (version=0.4)
    And user says "Also mention PropTypes for non-TS projects"
    And Cascade updates activity guidance again (version=0.5)
    Then activity guidance includes both TypeScript and PropTypes examples
    And all version increments are tracked
