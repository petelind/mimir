  I want to use MCP tools with playbooks
  So that I can enhance methodology with AI assistance

  Background:

    And she can select and execute a tool

  Scenario: MCP-03 AI-generated content
    Given Maria creates a new activity
    When she clicks [Generate with AI]
    Then MCP suggests activity details
    And she can accept or modify suggestions

  Scenario: MCP-04 MCP tool results
    Given Maria executes an MCP tool
    Then she sees tool output
    And she can save output to activity/artifact

  Scenario: MCP-05 MCP history
    Given Maria used MCP tools
    When she views MCP History
    Then she sees all tool executions with results

  Scenario: MCP-06 Disconnect MCP
