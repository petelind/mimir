Feature: Playbook Versioning and Lifecycle Management
    As a methodology author
    I want automatic version tracking for my draft playbooks
    And controlled change management for released playbooks
    So that I can iterate freely during development but maintain stability in production

    Background:
        Given I am logged in as "maria@ux.com"
