Feature: FOB-WORKFLOWS-LIST+FIND-1 Workflows List and Search
  As a methodology author (Maria)
  I want to view, search, and filter workflows within a playbook
  So that I can manage execution sequences effectively

  Background:
    Given Maria is authenticated in FOB
    And she is viewing playbook "React Frontend Development v1.2"
    And the playbook has 3 workflows:
      | name                    | activities | phases | order |
      | Component Development   |          8 |      2 |     1 |
      | State Management Setup  |          6 |      0 |     2 |
      | Testing & Documentation |         10 |      3 |     3 |

  Scenario: WF-LIST-01 Navigate to workflows list from playbook
    Given Maria is on FOB-PLAYBOOKS-VIEW_PLAYBOOK-1
    When she clicks the "Workflows" tab
