  As a methodology author (Maria)
  I want to navigate FOB efficiently
  So that I can access my work quickly

  Background:
    Given Maria is authenticated in FOB
    And she is on FOB-DASHBOARD-1

  Scenario: NAV-01 View dashboard overview
    Given Maria is on the dashboard
    Then she sees "My Playbooks" section with 5 most recently accessed playbooks
    And she sees "Recently Used" section showing last 10 accessed items (Playbooks/Workflows/Activities) with usage counts
    And she sees quick action buttons for Create/Import/Sync
    
  Scenario: NAV-01a Recently Used section shows usage statistics
    Given Maria is on the dashboard
    And she has accessed "React Frontend Development" playbook 15 times
    And she last accessed it 2 hours ago
    When she views the "Recently Used" section

    And she sees a [View] button to quickly navigate to it
    
  Scenario: NAV-01b Recently Used tracks only views, not edits
    Given Maria is on the dashboard
    When she views the "Recently Used" section

    And it is NOT an audit trail or activity log
